# Delivery Logistics Dashboard

This project showcases an end-to-end **Power BI logistics dashboard** designed to analyze delivery costs, delays, and service performance.

Using structured CSV data and Excel-based KPI validation, the dashboard identifies operational patterns and inefficiencies across regions, distances, weather conditions, package types, and delivery partners.

---

## Key Insights
- Long-distance deliveries drive higher costs with lower service ratings.
- Adverse weather conditions significantly increase delivery delays.
- Performance varies notably across delivery partners in cost efficiency and reliability.
- Higher delivery speed does not always translate into better service outcomes.

---

## Key Metrics
- Total Orders
- Average Cost per Delivery
- On-Time vs Delayed Rate
- Delay Rate and Success Rate
- Average Delivery Time

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI (data modeling, DAX measures, visualization)
- Excel (KPI validation and exploratory analysis)
- CSV data sources

---

## Project Objective
To demonstrate the ability to translate logistics data into actionable business insights and support decision-making in operational and performance-driven environments.

---

## Notes
The dataset is simulated and used exclusively for educational and portfolio purposes.
